University of Tasmania Fire Centre

An R package containing a variety of functions developed by the
[University of Tasmania Fire Centre](https://firecentre.org.au/). This
includes functions for calculating a range of fire weather indices,
calculating spatial landscape metrics over fire regime rasters, and a
spatial model of urban-rural fire risk incorporating radiant heat and
ember transport.

Package development was support by [Natural Hazards Research
Australia](https://www.naturalhazards.com.au) project [Bushfire Risk a
the Urban-Rural
Interface](https://www.naturalhazards.com.au/research/research-projects/bushfire-risk-rural-urban-interface).
